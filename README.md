Welcome to the AI Tic Tac Toe Solver! This project leverages the different language models to determine the best moves in a game of Tic Tac Toe. The model suggests a move, by Play Agent, which is then judged by a Judge Agent using LangGraph. It is submitted if the move is deemed good; otherwise, the model is prompted for a new move.

### Features
- Developed by LangGraph
- Comparing different models like GPT-4o, Llama 3.1, Gemma 2, Mistral v0.3 and Mixtral v0.1
- Implementing Judge and Play Agents
