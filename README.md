Welcome to the AI Tic Tac Toe Solver! This project leverages the Llama 3 language model to determine the best moves in a game of Tic Tac Toe. The model suggests a move, which is then judged by a function using LangChain. If the move is deemed good, it is submitted; otherwise, the model is prompted for a new move.

### Features
- Uses the Llama 3 language model to generate moves.
- Judges the quality of moves with a custom function.
